# Mini-Linter-Codecademy
In this project, you will use what you know about iterating over arrays to improve the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph.

I have finished this project including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd part of the task 8. 
8.1 For the overused words, remove it every other time it appears.
8.2 Write a function that finds the word that appears the greatest number of times.
8.3 Replaced overused words with something else.
